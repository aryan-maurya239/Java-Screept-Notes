In JavaScript, **keywords** are reserved words that have specific meanings and uses within the language. They cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names, function names, or class names). Below is a detailed list of JavaScript keywords grouped by their functionality.

---

### **1. Declarations**

| **Keyword**  | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `var`        | Declares a variable (function-scoped and allows re-declaration). |
| `let`        | Declares a block-scoped variable (introduced in ES6). |
| `const`      | Declares a block-scoped constant that cannot be reassigned. |
| `function`   | Declares a function. |
| `class`      | Declares a class (introduced in ES6). |

### **2. Control Flow**

| **Keyword**  | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `if`         | Executes a block of code if a condition evaluates to `true`. |
| `else`       | Executes a block of code if the `if` condition evaluates to `false`. |
| `else if`    | Adds an additional condition to an `if` statement. |
| `switch`     | Executes code based on matching case values. |
| `case`       | Specifies a condition in a `switch` statement. |
| `default`    | Specifies the code to run if no `case` matches. |
| `for`        | Creates a loop that is executed a specific number of times. |
| `while`      | Creates a loop that runs while a condition is `true`. |
| `do`         | Creates a loop that runs at least once, then checks the condition. |
| `break`      | Exits a loop or `switch` statement prematurely. |
| `continue`   | Skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next one. |
| `try`        | Defines a block of code to test for errors. |
| `catch`      | Defines a block of code to handle errors. |
| `finally`    | Defines a block of code that runs after `try` and `catch`. |
| `throw`      | Throws an exception (used for error handling). |

### **3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

| **Keyword**  | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `this`       | Refers to the current object or execution context. |
| `class`      | Defines a class. |
| `extends`    | Creates a subclass of another class. |
| `constructor`| Defines the constructor method in a class. |
| `super`      | Refers to the parent class constructor or methods. |
| `new`        | Creates an instance of an object or calls a constructor function. |

### **4. Asynchronous Programming**

| **Keyword**  | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `async`      | Declares an asynchronous function. |
| `await`      | Pauses an `async` function until a Promise is resolved or rejected. |

---

### **5. Modules**

| **Keyword**  | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `import`     | Imports functions, objects, or primitives from a module. |
| `export`     | Exports functions, objects, or primitives from a module. |
| `default`    | Defines the default export of a module. |

---

### **6. Working with Values**

| **Keyword**  | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `null`       | Represents the intentional absence of any value. |
| `undefined`  | Indicates that a variable has been declared but not assigned a value. |
| `NaN`        | Represents a value that is "not a number". |
| `typeof`     | Returns the type of a value or variable. |
| `instanceof` | Tests whether an object is an instance of a class or constructor. |
| `in`         | Checks whether a property exists in an object. |
| `void`       | Evaluates an expression but does not return a value. |

---

### **7. Scope and Blocks**

| **Keyword**  | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `return`     | Exits a function and optionally returns a value. |
| `yield`      | Pauses a generator function and returns a value. |
| `delete`     | Deletes a property from an object or an element from an array. |
| `with`       | Extends the scope chain (deprecated and not recommended). |

---

### **8. Reserved Future Keywords**
These words are reserved for future use and cannot be used as identifiers, even if they currently have no functionality.

- `enum`
- `implements`
- `interface`
- `package`
- `protected`
- `private`
- `public`
- `static`

### **9. Literals**

| **Keyword**  | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `true`       | Represents a Boolean true value. |
| `false`      | Represents a Boolean false value. |

---

### **10. Miscellaneous**

| **Keyword**  | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `debugger`   | Stops the execution of JavaScript and calls debugging functions (if available). |
| `async`      | Used with functions to work with Promises asynchronously. |

---

### **Summary**
JavaScript keywords are essential for writing structured, functional, and maintainable code. They are reserved and cannot be redefined or repurposed in a program.
